# Java OOP Coursework Project

## Module
Object Oriented Programming

## Description
This repository contains solutions for the Java OOP coursework, covering both
console-based and GUI-based applications as specified in the coursework questions.

## Question One
### Part A: Students Grader
A console-based Java application that:
- Accepts scores for five students using a while loop
- Determines grades and remarks based on the Uganda O-Level grading system
- Displays individual results and a summary of grades

### Part B: SK Motors Auction System
A console-based Java application that:
- Accepts three bidders and selects the highest bidder
- Captures vehicle details, deposits, expenses, and balances
- Computes and displays profit or loss

## Question Two
### Student Registration System (GUI)
A Java Swing desktop application that:
- Replicates a student registration form
- Performs full input validation
- Generates a formatted student record
- Saves records to a CSV file (students.csv) as specified in the coursework instructions

## Data Storage
- Student records are initially saved to a CSV file generated by the Java application.
- For submission purposes, the CSV file was imported into Microsoft Access and saved
  as an Access database file (.accdb), which is also provided in this repository.

## Notes
- The project strictly follows the requirements stated in the coursework questions.
- CSV-based storage is used as specified in Question Two.
- The included Access database file satisfies the submission checklist requirement
  for providing an .accdb database.
